# Setup Guide for Twilight Princess Archipelago

Welcome to Twilight Princess Archipelago! This guide will help you set up the randomizer and play your first multiworld.
Whether playing, generating, or hosting an Archipelago room with Twilight Princess, you must follow a few simple steps to
get started.

Unfortunately, Mac OS is not officially supported at this time.

## Requirements

You'll need the following components to be able to play/generate with Twilight Princess:

- Install [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) v0.5.1 or higher.\
   **Make sure to install the Generator if you intend to generate multiworlds.**
- The latest version of the [TP APWorld](https://github.com/tanjo3/tp_apworld/releases/latest).

If you're playing Twilight Princess, you'll also need:

- Install [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/).\
   **We recommend using the latest release.**
- The latest version of the [TWW AP Randomizer Build](https://github.com/tanjo3/wwrando/releases/latest).
- A Twilight Princess ISO (North American version), probably named "Legend of Zelda, The - Twilight Princess (USA).iso".

If you intend to play under Linux, you will need to consider the following information.

- Grab the `tar.gz` version of Archipelago, not the `AppImage`. The file name should be similar to the following on the
  release page: `Archipelago_X.X.X_linux-x86_64.tar.gz`.
- For Dolphin, you can use the flatpak package
  [available on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu).

## Installation

All users should follow these steps:

1. Unzip the downloaded TP APWorld zip file.
2. Double-click the `Twilight Princess.apworld` file. It should automatically install the APWorld after a little while. You will get a
   little dialog window telling you it has been installed successfully. \* Alternatively, copy the `Twilight Princess.apworld` to your Archipelago installation's `custom_worlds` folder (Windows default
   to: `%programdata%/Archipelago`).
3. Copy the contents of the `lib` folder in the downloaded TWW APWorld zip file to your Archipelago installation's `lib`
   folder.

If you're playing Twilight Princess, you must also download the REL loader from https://tprandomizer.com/ and place both that file and the gci file in the save data of dolphin

## Setting Up a YAML

All players playing Twilight Princess must provide the room host with a YAML file containing the settings for their world.
The TP APWorld download includes a sample YAML file for Twilight Princess. The comments in that file explain each
setting's function.

Once you're happy with your settings, provide the room host with your YAML file and proceed to the next step.

Note: As this is still early alpha changing settings in the YAML my not work / do anything (I recomend only changing the player name for now)

## Generating a Multiworld

If you're generating a multiworld game that includes Twilight Princess, you'll need to do so locally as the online
generator does not yet support Twilight Princess. Follow these steps to generate a multiworld:

1. Gather all player's YAMLs. Place these YAMLs into the `Players` folder of your Archipelago installation. If the
   folder does not exist, then it must be created manually. The files here should not be compressed.
2. Modify any local host settings for generation, as desired.
3. Run `ArchipelagoGenerate.exe` (without `.exe` on Linux) or click `Generate` in the launcher. The generation output
   is placed in the `output` folder (usually named something like `AP_XXXXX.zip`). \* Please note that if any player in the game you want to generate plays a game that needs a ROM file to generate,
   you will need the corresponding ROM files. A ROM file is not required for Twilight Princess at this stage.
4. Unzip the `AP_XXXXX.zip` file. It should include a `aptp` file for each player in the room playing Twilight Princess.
   Each file will be named `AP_XXXXX_P#_<name>.aptp`, where `#` corresponds to that player's slot number and `<name>` is
   their slot (player) name. Distribute each file to the appropriate player.
5. In the next section, use the archive file `AP_XXXXX.zip` to host a room or provide it to the room host.

## Hosting a Room

If you're generating the multiworld, follow the instructions in the previous section. Once you have the zip file
corresponding to your multiworld, follow
[these steps](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#hosting-an-archipelago-server) to host a room. Follow
the instructions for hosting on the website from a locally generated game or on a local machine.

## Connecting to a Room

You should have the `.aptp` file provided to you by the multiworld generator. You should also have the room's server
name and port number from the room's host.

Once you do, follow these steps to connect to the room:

1. Visit https://generator.tprandomizer.com/s/aptest to download the gci file needed to run the randomizer, Feel free to randomize cosmetics and audio as you would like
2. If you haven't gotten the REL loader and randomizer files, now is a good time to do that.
3. Open Dolphin and use it to open Twilight Princess.
4. Start the REL loader save file and select APTest as the seed you want to use.
5. Start a new save file with links name as the name you gave for the multi world.
6. Start `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe` (without `.exe` on Linux) and choose `Twilight Princess Client`, which will open the
   text client. If Dolphin is not already open you will be prompted to do so.
7. Connect to the room by entering the server name and port number at the top and pressing `Connect`. For rooms hosted
   on the website, this will be `archipelago.gg:<port>`, where `<port>` is the port number. If a game is hosted from the
   `ArchipelagoServer.exe` (without `.exe` on Linux), this will default to `38281` but may be changed in the `host.yaml`.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that you are running version v0.5.1 or higher of Archipelago.
- If you do not see the client in the launcher, ensure the `Twilight Princess.apworld` file is in the correct folder (the
  `custom_worlds` folder of your Archipelago installation). Additionally, ensure you have copied the contents of the `lib`
  folder in the downloaded TWW APWorld zip file to your Archipelago installation's `lib` folder.
- If the client is not working, double-check that you have the most recent release of the `Twilight Princess.apworld` file.
  Ensure that the content of the `lib` folder from the release download has been placed in
  your Archipelago installation's `lib` folder.
- Ensure that you do not have any Dolphin cheats or codes enabled. Some cheats or codes can unexpectedly interfere with
  emulation and make troubleshooting errors difficult.
- If you get an error message, ensure that `Enable Emulated Memory Size Override` in Dolphin (under `Options` >
  `Configuration` > `Advanced`) is **disabled**.
- If you run with a custom GC boot menu, you'll need to skip it by going to `Options` > `Configuration` > `GameCube`
  and checking `Skip Main Menu`.
